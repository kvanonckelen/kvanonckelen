# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kevin Van Onckelen

I'm a **hobby developer** with a deep curiosity about everything in the digital world — from how servers tick to building creative, fun-looking applications. Tech has always fascinated me, and over time, I’ve dived into everything from frontend design to backend infrastructure.

## 💻 What I Do

By day, I'm an **Automation Engineer**, building, deploying, and maintaining SCADA applications. Before that, I was an IT Support Engineer, where I gained hands-on experience with both **cloud** and **private computing** environments.

By night (and weekends), I explore the world of **software development**, playing around with:

- 🌐 Full-stack app development
- 🚀 Creative & intuitive UI design
- ⚙️ Infrastructure tech like **Nginx**, **Docker**, and **Kubernetes**

I like to think of myself as a *"Swiss Army knife"* — I might not specialize in just one area, but I know **a lot about a lot**, and that helps me bring diverse perspectives to any project I work on.

## ✨ What I Love

- Building unique and engaging apps
- Creating solutions where I can blend logic with creativity
- Exploring new tools, tech stacks, and dev practices
- Helping others and always staying eager to learn
